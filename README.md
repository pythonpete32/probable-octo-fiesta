# Remix Ethereum Boilerplate App

A Remix front end for ethereum apps.

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Deployment

You only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
pnpm i
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

## UI components

The boilerplate uses a fork of the [Aragon UI](https://ui.aragon.org/getting-started/) as component library.
